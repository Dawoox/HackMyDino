# HackMyDino
## My personal hacks for the original Chrome Dino Game.
---
### What's that ?
This project is a JS hack for the Chrome Dinosaur game, when you don't have any WiFi or when you are on the [chrome://dino](chrome://dino) url.
### Why ?
Simply because I was bored. And because I wanted to do live again ([https://twitch.tomaru.dev](https://twitch.tomaru.dev) :3)
### How ?
In JavaScript, during my [Twitch lives](https://twitch.tomaru.dev), in a few days.
### Ok, how do we install it ?
Well, let's. Several solutions, either you launch Chrome and you mark in the URL chrome://dino, or you go to [chrome://dino](chrome://dino), you do "Control + Shift + I", you click on the "Console" tab, and you make a copy&paste of the content of "Hack.min.js". Press "Enter", and that's it !
### Thanks, but how do we use it ?
It's very simple.
